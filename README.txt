Hand Drawn Hero was created in Game Maker:
http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker

The idea behind the project was to create a series of mini games
(platformer, scrolling shooter, boss fight) in 10 seconds or less.

The aesthetics were themed around a child's scribblings on paper.

Controls:
A: Move left
D: Move right
S: Move down (scrolling shooter only)
W: Jump (platformer/boss fight), Move up (scrolling shooter only)
Spacebar: Shoot

Additional information:
Your 10 second death timer will reset upon death or level completion
You can extend the timer by killing enemies
Beat the game once for a surprise!

Thanks for playing!
